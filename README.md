# XML to SQL

This Java program should help merging XML data into a MySQL database.

In the final version you should be able to select corresponding columns from XML file (local or web based) and merge them into already existing MySQL database.
Works in command line, no GUI planned.

To run the program you must first run the server and then the main class.
For testing purposes you can use:
1. xmlFiles directory as the XML source;
2. Database with these credentials:
* user: xmltosql
* password: xmltosql
* database name: xmltosql
* database host: db4free.net
